# Cross Site Cookie Demo

## How to run
- Run server: `npm run server`
- Run client `npm run client`

If you don't have `nodemon` installed change the package script to use `node`.

Access the `https://localhost:3001` and click `Req` button then see the cookie set in browser's devtool.

**Extra:**
If you have access to different ip address. Deploy this app on that and see if it's working.
